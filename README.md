Project 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: approximately 2 hours spent in total

Objective: Setup a honeypot and intercept some attempted attacks in the wild.



For this asiignment, I created 2 VMs (mhn-admin and mhn-honeypot-1) and set it up based on the assignment by following the codepath instructions. I demonstrated an attack on mhn-honeypot-1 and captured it through the admin console.

The gif file named "Week 9 demonstration.gif" is the video demonstration of this attack and its detection in the admin console.

A json export of the data that I collected is stored in "session.json" file.

A screenshot is also included that displays total number of attacks and top 5 attackers.
